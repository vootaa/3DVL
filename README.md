üßæ Attribution & Credits

This project is an early-stage experimental fork of the TresJS Showcase, created by the amazing @tresjs team.

I'd like to give them a huge thank you for building such an approachable and well-structured foundation‚Äînone of this would have been possible without it.

üèóÔ∏è What‚Äôs Different

While the original codebase remains the foundation, this fork has introduced:
 ‚Ä¢ Custom rendering effects (e.g., plasma-style shaders, arc links)
 ‚Ä¢ Chainweb blockchain visualization (inspired by Kadena‚Äôs architecture)
 ‚Ä¢ Experimental interactions and layout tweaks
 ‚Ä¢ AI-assisted code modifications and additions

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: I‚Äôm not a professional frontend or Web3D developer. This project began as a zero-experience learning experiment.

Most of the implementation and modifications were done with the help of AI tools (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) while gradually understanding how things work.

üí° Why This Exists

The primary motivation behind this fork was to explore how on-chain data from Kadena‚Äôs Chainweb structure could be visualized in 3D.

The initial demo was shared to gauge interest from the Chainweb blockchain community, not to present a polished or independent Web3D project.

In hindsight, the lack of context may have caused confusion or distress to developers in the Web3D space. This was not my intention, and I sincerely appreciate your feedback.
