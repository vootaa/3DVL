## üßæ Attribution & Credits

This project is an early-stage experimental fork of the TresJS Showcase, created by the amazing @tresjs team.

 ‚Ä¢ Lab site: <https://lab.tresjs.org/>

 ‚Ä¢ GitHub repo: <https://github.com/Tresjs/lab>

 ‚Ä¢ Original space game code:
<https://github.com/Tresjs/lab/tree/main/components/content/space-game>

A huge thank you to the TresJS team for building such an approachable and well-structured foundation ‚Äî none of this would have been possible without your work.

üß≠ Additional Credits

Some of the original visual elements and scene designs used in the [TresJS Lab Space Game](https://github.com/Tresjs/lab/tree/main/components/content/space-game) were adapted or inspired by the fantastic work of the [@pmndrs](https://github.com/pmndrs) team.

While I initially missed this in my understanding of the source chain, I want to sincerely thank them and credit their exceptional contributions to the Web3D and ThreeJS ecosystem.

üèóÔ∏è What‚Äôs Different

This fork is an open-ended experiment. The possible development direction includes:

 ‚Ä¢ Building on TresJS‚Äôs capabilities demonstrated in the original space game, evolving toward a full-featured Web3 visualization project

 ‚Ä¢ Using Web3D to represent the multi-chain structure of Kadena‚Äôs Chainweb, creating a real-time, interactive blockchain exploration scene

 ‚Ä¢ Leveraging GitHub Copilot and AI coding models to iteratively implement new features and custom shaders

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note:

I‚Äôm not a professional frontend or Web3D developer. This project began as a zero-experience learning journey.

Most of the implementation and modifications were done with the help of AI tools (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT), while learning and experimenting step by step.

‚∏ª

üí° Why This Exists

The main motivation behind this fork was to explore whether Kadena‚Äôs Chainweb architecture could be visualized in a compelling, real-time 3D format using open web tools.

The initial demo was shared to gauge interest from the $KDA and Chainweb communities, rather than to present a polished or standalone Web3D project.

In hindsight, the lack of proper context may have caused confusion or frustration for developers in the Web3D space. That was never the intention, and I sincerely appreciate the feedback and perspective from the community.
